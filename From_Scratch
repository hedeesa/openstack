OpenStack Services 
  Compute service -------------------- NOVA
                                            It is responsible for managing compute instance lifecycle.
  Accelerators resource management --- CYBORG 
  Object store ----------------------- SWIFT
                                            It works with binary objects to store data in a distributed, replicated way.
                                            works like a proxy
                                            apps are using RESTful API to talk to swift
                                            
  Block storage ---------------------- CINDER 
                                            It provides persistent storage to instances.
                                            the idea is that instant storage, by default, is ephemeral.
                                            That is also like booting from a Linux live CD.
                                            If you are working from a Linux live CD, if you ever try to change the configuration file,
                                            where would you change it to?
                                            
  Networking ------------------------- NEUTRON 
  Identity Service ------------------- KEYSTONE 
                                            Keystone is using a database, which is the MariaDB database, to store information
  Dashboard -------------------------- Horizon
  Image Service ---------------------- GLANCE
                                              is used to store virtual machine disk images.
                                              Cirros test image = is only like thirteen megabytes, 
                                                                  and this is a minimal Linux operating system.
                                              
                                              
  Instance = Virtual Machine 
  Persistent storage =  is any data storage device that retains data after power to that device is shut off.
