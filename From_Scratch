OpenStack Services 
  Compute service -------------------- NOVA

  Object store ----------------------- SWIFT
                                            It works with binary objects to store data in a distributed, replicated way.
                                            works like a proxy
                                            apps are using RESTful API to talk to swift
                                            
  Block storage ---------------------- CINDER 
                                            It provides persistent storage to instances.
                                            the idea is that instant storage, by default, is ephemeral.
                                            That is also like booting from a Linux live CD.
                                            If you are working from a Linux live CD, if you ever try to change the configuration file,
                                            where would you change it to?
